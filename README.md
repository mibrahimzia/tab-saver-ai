1.  **Grab your free-tier API key here:** [OpenRouter API Key Management](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2.  Open the extension files.
3.  Locate the file containing the API key i.e. (`background.js`) at the top where it says YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY_HERE
4.  Replace the existing key with your new key to use the extension.
